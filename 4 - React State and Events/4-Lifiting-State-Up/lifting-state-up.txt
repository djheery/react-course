Lifting State Up
================

What is lifting state up?

Consider this component tree

<App /> 
  ||
  ||
  =======> <Expenses />
  ||
  ||
  =======> <NewExpense />

An app component renders both the Expenses component and the NewExpense component

The NewExpense component, 
  - Data/ State is generated here

The Expenses component 
  - Data/ State is needed here 

We would like to hand the data from NewExpense to Expenses 
  - We cannot do this directly as in react you can only parents and their children can communicate with each other

To share between the two we must share the data to the closest relative which both components share. 
  - In this case the App component
  - This component can be used to store the state of both of the components
    - Thus the NewExpense component will lift it's own state up and pass it to the App component so that the <App /> component can pass the new state down to the Expenses component via props enabling it to update itself.

This can be seen in the NewExpense and ExpenseForm components as they lift their state up.
