Debugging 

Errors will always be a part of development thus you must know how to debug them 

In this module we will focus on debugging errors in react

We will:
  - Understand React Error Messages
  - Explore Debugging & Analyzing React Apps
  - Explore Using react Dev Tools 

JSX code must be enclosed within one Parent Div
  - This is due to React running React.createElement(

    ......Elements
  )

  under the hood. Thus it is containing all the elements with this code.

  You can debug by setting breakpoints using the browser src/debugger section of the dev console. 
    - Simply find the file that you want to set a breakpoint then click the line you want to set the breakpoint on 
      - You can view the information received bby the method you are debugging by hovering over the variables within the method. 
    - Never knew you could do this 
    - When the browser reaches the point you have marked as a breakpoint on execution of the code, the code will stop and will allow you insight into what is going on 

  You can also use React developer tools extension 
    - You get a new section on the dev tools saying components and profile 
      - This allows you to see the props that are passed to various components 
      - Which components are responsible for rendering it in order of which is most closely responsible for rendering the components 
      - You can Search for components 
      -You see hooks that are being used.
        - Such as useState()
