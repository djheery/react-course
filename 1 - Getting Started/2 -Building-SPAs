Building Single Paged Applications (SPAs) with React

When working with react we build "Single Paged Applications"

You can have a widget based approach to react for a multi-page application (Where pages are still rendered and served by a backend)

It is more common to control an entire frontend with react - i.e movement between pages, interactions etc. 
It will look like the frontend is making a request to a new page when switching page, but with react - the server ONLY SENDS ONE HTML PAGE - after this React controls the UI.

The advantage to this is that it leads to a smoother UI and better User Experience
