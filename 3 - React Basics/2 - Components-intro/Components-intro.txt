Whatr are Components and why is React all about them

React simplifies building user interfaces

Components - React is all about them

All user interfaces are made up of Components
Examples of components could be repeated items with different data,
Components are reusable building blocks within your user interface

You combine the building blocks to build a final user interface

This is great for reusablity and seperation of concerns

- reusablity => don't repeat yourself
- seperation of concerns => Sepeate your code into relevant and sections - this makes the code in react more maintainable and scalable and prevents errors due to muddled code
