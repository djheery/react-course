When building a react app it is good to start with a tool such as create react app

This allows you to use pre configured folders with basic react code files
Most importantly with config files that help you build the react app when moving from dev to production
Also it allows you to have a dev enviroment which loads the react app on a browser

The steps are as follows in the terminal

npx create-react-app [app-name]
cd [app-name]
npm start // this runs the local server
