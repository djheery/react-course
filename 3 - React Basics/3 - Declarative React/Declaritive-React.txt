React Code is Written in a Declaritive Way!

How is a Component Built

User Interfaces are about HTML CSS And JS

React combines all these elements
CSS is the least important part - it is not the focus of react
React allows you to create reuseable and reactive components consiting of HTML and JS

React is Declaritive
You will always define the desired end states and let react figure out the desired vanilla JS DOM instructions

THis differs to vanilla JS as you have to define and everything step by step (imperative approach)

Simplified

You build your own custom HTML elements and allow react to do the imperative work
