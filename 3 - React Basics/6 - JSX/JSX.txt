What is JSX

Simply put it is HTML code placed within a JavaScript file

JSX Stands for JavaScript XML

HTML is XML apparently?

The process behind the scenes is transforming JSX into regular HTML

If you look at the source files within main.chunk.js and cmd-f to find the App,js code you will see what the source code actually looks like. (The code that runs in the browser)

This is code we would not want to write this is why its great to use JSX and you will use it with react.
