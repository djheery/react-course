Render method

The Render Method takes two arguments

The 2nd Argument is a default JS DOM object

Example from index.js:

-----------------------------

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

------------------------------

Wonder why there is no html file? Look in the public folder and note the singular html file. This is the single HTML file that is sent to the browser. 

Remember that react acts as a kind of server when users are making requests for different pages or general interactions with the page.

On this single file we import the finished react code and then it is the code that updates what we see on the screen.

In the HTML file there is a div with the id of root, that div is generally what is being targeted and subsequently rendered

What is the "<App />"

This is a Syntax called JSX

App is a component - thus the render method is saying Render the App component (in App.js) within the selected DOM element ('#root')

App.js code: 

----------------------------
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
----------------------------

This returns HTML code within a JS file
This is called JSX
