CSS Styling

You still use CSS as normal with a few minor tweaks.

It is a best practice to include the components css file with the exact same name as the original JSX file.

For Example: 
Expenseitem.js => CSS File => ExpenseItem.css

This is so that they appear directly next too eachother in the menu.

// Classes

To include a class within your JSX elements rather than use the keyword class='...', you must use the keyword: className='...'.

This is because 'class' is a predetermined property selector in JavaScript

// import

To render the css styling of a component within react you have to import the css file - example

import "./ExpenseItem.css", react will not do this automatically
