How React Works

We update the App.js in this lesson and added a paragraph

--------------------
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
      <p>This is Also Visible</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

--------------------

This lesson is just a reiteration of what is happening with the react app and its declaritive nature

e.g. 

We create a component based UI using JavaScript and JSX => React does the lifiting and all of the imperative work behind the scenes => This is what is rendered on the screen.

THis is a Declaritive approach.

for Example

In the above code we only had to input a p tag and react knows what to render.

if we wrote this in vanilla JS it would be something to the accord of

function App () {
const para = document.createElement('p').textContent = This is also visible
document.getElementById('#root').append(para);
}

This works but will get cumbersome. With react we just define the desired endstate andreact does all of that work behind the scenes.
