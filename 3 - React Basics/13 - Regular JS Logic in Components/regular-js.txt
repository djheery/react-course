Regular JS Logic within React components

Note: Props values can be hard coded 
e.g <ExpenseItem title="Toilet Paper"/></ExpenseItem>
This will be passed into our props param within the targeted component function.

The main idea with props is to pass data into our component functions to produce dynamic reusable content.

We are going to manipulate the look of the Date object by making it look like a calendar

To do this we use the toLocaleString function which makes the date object recieved via the new Date() within the property more ledgable 

toLocaleString() takes in two params 1st being the language/ region you want the date format to be and the second being an object with the options (find more in the MDN article on toLocaleString())

rather than writing tit inline like this:
<div>{props.date.toLocaleString('en-us', {month: long})}</div>

it is better to write it as a constant then target it within the div

const month = props.date.toLocaleString('en-us', {month: long})
return(
  <div>{month}</div>
  )

This keeps the JSX code more ledgeable and maintainable

REMEMBER DATES ARE LIKE ARRAYS 0 Indexed
i.e January = 0
    December = 11
