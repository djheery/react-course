JSX - Slightly more complex

In this lecture we are manipulating the JSX in 'ExpenseItem.js' to make it more interesting

We are adding the amount of the expense and the date.

With JSX you MUST only have 1 root element per return statement (per JSX Snippit),
For Example:

return <div>Date</div><div><h2>Title</h2><div>Amount</div></div> or eaven 

return <div> Date </div>
       <div><h2>Title</h2>
        <div>Time</div>
       </div>

The lecturer says why this is not possible in later lecture within this section.

How do you work around this, you do this by wrapping the code into 1 root element.
For Example: 

ExpenseItem.js
---------------
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Date</div>
      <div>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <div>Amount</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
----------------

Note how the divs are wrapped in parentheses - This signals react that this is all one component, wrap this round return statements when using JSX code.
