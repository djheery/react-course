Classes 

Classes are blueprints for objects,

A class can have both properties (key/ value) and methods (funtions)

Classes are a more convenient way of creating constructor functions
Classes allow inheritance

Examples

//Property
class Person {
  name = "max" // key - value
  call = () => console.log(name) // method 
}

// Usage 
const myPerson = new Person()
myPerson.call() 
// .call() is a method only available to that class see above

//Inheritance
class Person extends Master 
// this syntax allows the class to inherit all the properties of another class whilst building upon it e.g this specific example would make Person inherit all methods of a seperate "Master" class -- similar to prototypes
