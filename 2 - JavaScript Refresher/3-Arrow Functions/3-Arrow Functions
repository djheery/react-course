Arrow functions

Common in ES6

A sleeker way of writing functions,
Allows us to define a function as a constant,
Beware of the Lexical "this" => I still do not understand THIS (You cannot use this - within an arrow function as it will pertain to the window object)

ES5

function hello(x) {
  return `${x} World`
}

hello("Hello")

ES6

const hello = (x) {
  return `${x} World`
}

console.log(hello('hello'))

Great when wanting to recieve a value/values from another function and define it as a new variable
