Classes Properties and methods

Properties are like Variables attached to classes and objects
Methods are like functions attached to classes and objects

The syntax has changed slightly for ease of use in ES7,
Below I will include ES6 Syntax directly followed by ES7 syntax

Properties - ES6
constructor() {
  this.myProperty = "value"
}

Properties - ES7
myProperty = "value"

Methods - ES6
myMethod() {
  console.log('This is an ES6 Method')
}

Methods - ES7
myMethod = () => console.log('This is an ES7 Method')
