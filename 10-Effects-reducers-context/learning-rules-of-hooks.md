# Rules of Hooks 

1. Only call react hooks in react functions 
  - This could be in react component functions or custom hooks. 
2. Only call react hooks at the Top Level of your React component functions 
  - Do not call them in nested functions 
  - Do not call them in any block statements. 
3. Add everything you refer to inside of useEffect() as a dependency
