# Introduction to Next JS 

This module explores Next JS.
Next JS is a framework for building upon React. 

This Module explains 

- What next js is
  - Why use next JS
- File Based routing 
- Page Pre-rendering 
- Full stack applications & adding API's 

## What is NextJS 

NextJS is the "React Framework for Production". 

NextJS could be reffered too as a Fullstack framework for ReactJS.

How is NextJS a Framework? 

React is known as a library rather than a framework, as it's main focus is components, state and props from a UI perspective. 
If you want to build large scale applications you need to add more librarys to enable features such as routing, etc. 

NextJS makes building large scale react apps easier. 
It adds many core features such as routing and server side rendering out of the box, this means that you don't have to add as many third party libraries. 

Framework 
  - A lot of features, that help you solve common problems & clear guidance on how to use the features 

## Features inside of next js: 

### Key Feature 1: Built in - Server Side Rendering

Next JS has built in server side rendering.
This means that it renders a page on the server, rather than on the client side. 
This is a lot better for the SEO as the content is not present in the source when rendering on the client side via JS.
This means that search engine crawlers cannot properly read your website content, which affect indexing. 

This blends clientside and serverside code.

## Key Feature 2: Simplified Routing with File Based Routing

Routing in NextJS enables file based routing as opposed to component routing using a library such as react-router-dom. 
You simply have a folder name pages and your structure in that folder defines the page structure. 

## Key Feature 3 : Build Full Stack Apps 

It makes it easy to add backend code to react projects. 
There can be standalone backend code such as adding our own backend api secure.
